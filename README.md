# StreamFunctionSolver
**Solving the Stream Function Equation:**
- Step 1: Developing a Python code that generates grids within the physical domain of an elbow.
- Step 2: Discretizing equations using the five-point and nine-point formulas and solving them using the
Gauss-Seidel, line Gauss-Seidel, and TDM methods.
- Step 3: Visualizing the results.

- The elbow geometery is equal to image below:
